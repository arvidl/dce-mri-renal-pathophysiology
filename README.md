#### ABSTRACT

Kidney function is related to maintenance of fluids, electrolytes,
acid-base balance and clearance of toxins. Normal kidney function is
maintained by coordinated regulation at different levels of organization
warranting an integrative approach to kidney function in health and
disease.
